# Weather app

A javacript app to get the information about the weather of the desired location.

## API's used

* [OpenCageData](https://opencagedata.com)
to get the information about the desired location.
* [DarkSky](https://darksky.net )
uses the information received to inform climate information.

These two API's are free, you can get more information when accessing their website, obviously they have paid versions.<br>
I recommend that you hide your API key in a backend using .env to prevent people from having access to your key when accessing information about the page
